            <h2>Introduction to Job Interview</h2>
            <p>
                The job interview is one of the most crucial steps in your career search process. It is the organization's opportunity to determine mutual fit. This guide brings you up to date best practices and step-by-step instructions for mastering the conversation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are basically three critical questions, often referred to as "the big three", that you need to be able to address in preparation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who are you?</li>
                <li>Why this position?</li>
                <li>Why this organization?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Interview FAQ</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>What should I wear to an interview?</strong><br>
                    Aim for professional attire that matches the organization's culture. When in doubt, it's better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed. Make sure your outfit is neat, comfortable, and distraction-free.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How do I research the company?</strong><br>
                    Start with the company's website, focusing on their mission, values, products/services, and recent news. Look for reviews on sites like Glassdoor and LinkedIn to get insights into company culture and employee experiences.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How early should I arrive?</strong><br>
                    Plan to arrive 10-15 minutes early. This gives you time to check in, relax, and mentally prepare without feeling rushed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What questions should I ask the interviewer?</strong><br>
                    Prepare 2-3 thoughtful questions that show your interest in the role and company. Examples include asking about team.
                </li>
                <li><strong>How do I follow up after the interview?</strong><br>
                    Send a thank-you email within 24 hours, expressing appreciation for the opportunity, reiterating your interest in the role, and briefly highlighting how your skills align with the position.
                </li>
